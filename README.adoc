*ljuv* is a Lua library built on https://libuv.org/[libuv] and https://luajit.org/[LuaJIT] 2.1 (HEAD).

A main event loop combined with coroutines can be a way to nicely parallelize and synchronize various operations, which is what computing is mostly about.

Not only a binding to *libuv*, the library aims to expose different levels of abstraction and address problems like multi-threading.

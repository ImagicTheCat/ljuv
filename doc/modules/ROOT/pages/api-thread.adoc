= Multi-threading

== Shared flag

=== ljuv.new_shared_flag(value [, final_value])

Create a shared flag.

value:: integer (C `int`)
final_value:: same as _value_, but set at finalization

=== shared_flag:set(value)

Set the shared flag's value.

value:: integer (C `int`)

=== shared_flag:get()

Returns the shared flag's value.

== Channel

=== ljuv.new_channel()

Create a channel.

=== channel:push(...)

Push a message.

...:: payload arguments (encoded by String Buffers)

=== channel:pull()

Pull a message (blocking).

Returns payload arguments.

=== channel:try_pull()

Pull a message (non-blocking).

Returns a boolean status, *true* followed by the payload arguments if a message has been pulled, or *false* otherwise.

=== channel:count()

Count the number of pending messages.

== Object transfer

=== ljuv.export(object [, soft])

Export an object to be passed to another thread.

.Exportables
channel::
shared flag::
async handle:: imported as a function which safely calls xref:api-handles.adoc#async-send[async:send]

WARNING: The returned payload must be imported exactly once to prevent memory leak and invalid memory accesses.

.Parameters
object::  object to export
soft:: truthy to not throw errors on invalid object (returns nothing)

Returns a payload encodable by String Buffers.

=== ljuv.import(payload [, soft])

Import an object payload.

payload::
soft:: truthy to not throw errors on invalid payload (returns nothing)

Returns imported object.

== Thread abstraction

=== loop:thread(entry, callback, ...)

Create a new system-thread and run a Lua function asynchronously.

The created Lua state inherits from the current values of `package.path` and `package.cpath`.

CAUTION: The loop will not synchronously wait on running threads if garbage collected; the application should asynchronously wait on the callback.

entry:: thread entry function, a Lua function or a string of Lua code/bytecode
+
NOTE: It uses `string.dump` to convert the Lua function to bytecode. Nothing will be done about the function's upvalues.

callback(ok, ...):: Called when terminated; common soft error handling interface: returns *ok* status followed by an error message or the function return values (encoded by String Buffers).
...:: arguments passed to the function, must be encodable by String Buffers

NOTE: The Lua VM of the thread is closed from the system thread of the loop.

== Threadpool abstraction

This abstraction, built on the previous one, implements a way to distribute operations among multiple threads from the "main" thread. Each thread instantiates the interface to process the work it is given.

I.e. main thread -> split workload -> worker threads -> gather results -> main thread.

=== loop:threadpool(thread_count, interface_loader, ...)

Create a system-thread pool.

thread_count:: number of threads in the pool
interface_loader:: Lua function or code, plain or bytecode, which returns a map of functions (called from worker threads)
...:: interface loader arguments

WARNING: Because each thread will execute the same interface loader, be careful to not use exported shared objects as arguments.

If the interface has an `__exit` function, it will be called before the end of the thread, after the exit of the work loop. It can be used to clean up interface resources.

[#threadpool:call]
=== threadpool:call(op, callback, ...)

Call an operation on the thread pool interface.

The callback can be a coroutine (will call `coroutine.resume` with the same parameters).

op:: key to an operation of the interface
callback(ok, ...):: Called on operation return, common soft error handling interface: returns *ok* status followed by an error message or the function return values (encoded by String Buffers).
...:: call arguments (encoded by String Buffers)

=== threadpool.interface[op](...)

Same as <<threadpool:call>>, but synchronously from the current coroutine. Errors are propagated.

pool.interface.test(42)

====

=== threadpool:close([callback])

Close the thread pool (send exit signal to all threads). Idempotent.

Without a callback (sync):: wait from the current coroutine
With a callback (async):: called when closed

NOTE: This method should be called when all work is done, because only the application knows the context of the work it yet has to give to the pool.

=== threadpool.tasks

Table/map of `id` => `callback`.

Can be used to check if the pool is busy (waiting on tasks to return).
